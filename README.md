# Sig Code Reader
This program is designed to encourage the improvement of pharmacies by allowing for Sig Code testing for pharmacy technicians and pharmacists.  Sig codes are the term used to denote shorthand directions from doctors that are written on medication bottles.  

# Installation
The installation for this program merely involves downloading the code for the program and running it. It should not require any setup involving external files.  Default file names and location stored in "Section Files" should not be modified or removed manually.

# Usage
The usage of this program will require the user to first enter sig codes and the phrases they stand for through usage of the add/remove feature.  This data must then be saved before access to either the section test or common sig test can be performed.  An error will be displayed if there are no sig codes in the selected file.  Default sig values are not pre-loaded because different pharmacy systems utilize slighlty different sig codes on occassion.
